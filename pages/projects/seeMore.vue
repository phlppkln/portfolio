      <p>
        As part of my masters program, I wanted to explore different
        perspectives and approaches on user centered design with an hands-on
        approach. Thus I started with the course “Design Thinking” where my
        group conducted a project on the topic: "Your Mobility Footprint -
        Awareness About Your Urban Paths and Habits". In groups of four we
        carried out various methods, that led to a fully functional prototype in
        the end.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p> We created a prototype that motivated citizens of the Seestadt to spend more time in urban nature and experience new places and activities in their area. Through Expert Interviews, Cultural Probes, Design Games, Wireframes and Mockup tests, and Technology Probes we gathered information to build a fully functional prototype. It consisted of a handheld device, called SeeExplorer, and multiple SeeCubes. Users locate the hidden SeeCubes with the SeeExplorer. Afterwards, they can hide them in public urban green spaces again and provide activities for the next user.</p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
      The first step was to collect appropriate ideas and approaches regarding
      the overall topic. We thought of possible problems that people have in
      their daily lives regarding mobility. Since this project is supported by
      the aspern.mobil LAB in the Seestadt, we focused on this part of the city.
      The Seestadt is an urban development area in an outer district of Vienna.
      The core idea of SeeMore is that mobility does not only influence external
      areas, it also has consequences on our personal well-being. A lot of
      people, especially in cities, struggle to spend enough time outdoors or in
      nature. SeeMore motivates people to integrate urban nature and physical
      activity in their daily lifes and help them be less stressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our overall goal is to improve city residents mental and physical
      well-being by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>motivating people to spend time in urban nature</li>
      <li>promoting physical activity on people's daily paths</li>
      <li>helping people to explore unknown green places</li>
      <li>find areas where new urban green elements could be beneficial</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      The first step in Design Thinking is to gather information on an idea.
      Thus we conducted several methods that allowed us to get insight into
      potential user's habits and preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>Literature Review and Expert Interviews</h3>
    <p>
      A review of related literature gave us a broad overview of our idea and a
      better understanding of important areas. We searched in various online
      scientific databases and focused on the classification of urban nature and
      the effects of urban green spaces on peoples well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
      We got some valuable insights on the role of urban nature in peoples lives
      and what kind of green elements should be included in our project. Overall
      we found out that urban nature has a lot of benefits for people living in
      cities. But they spend significantly less time in natural environments
      than people living on the countryside. This gave us the impression that
      our idea can contribute to people's well-being and improve their quality
      of living. The core findings were:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Urban green spaces are beneficial for mental and physical health. They
        provide stress reduction and promote physical activity.
      </li>
      <li>
        People value a variety of green elements. Although this is very
        subjective, most people prefer similar natural elements, like trees,
        grass, water, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Urban green spaces can be classified into categories. These categories
        can help us to find appropriate areas that we can include in the future
        phases of the prototype.
      </li>
      <li>
        Research distinguishes between different involvements in nature: viewing
        nature, being in the presence of nearby nature, and active participation
        and involvement with nature.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Next we conducted interviews with experts on urban mobility, design, urban
      public places, and the Seestadt. This gave us a better understanding of
      the context and how our project can contribute to people's mobility and
      lives.
    </p>

    <h3>Cultural Probe</h3>
    <p>
      After we got a first, broad understanding of our idea through the
      literature review and the expert interviews we conducted five cultural
      probes with participants from the Seestadt. They were recruited from a
      Facebook Group and from the streets of Seestadt. The main goal was to get
      people's perception of urban green spaces in the Seestadt and their
      associations with nature in general. The cultural probe consisted of a
      Polaroid camera and a notebook, where participants had to take notes for
      their chosen motifs. To integrate a playful element we also included
      plastilin and a box to safely store the crafted objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first task of participants was to use the Polaroid camera to capture
      pictures of natural elements in public places in the Seestadt. They were
      also asked to take notes on their intentions, why they took a picture. The
      second task was more open and focused on the role of nature in peoples
      daily lives. Participants were instructed to use the plastilin to create
      objects of things they associate with nature in general. After
      participants handed back the cultural probe we also conducted a short
      debrief interview with them. We asked them about their experience during
      the probe but also more general questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall the cultural probes revealed a lot of interesting points. In
      general people connect plants and animals with nature. But the living
      situation plays a major role on the perception of nature. For example
      participants with little children often associated urban green spaces with
      playgrounds or activities with their children. We also got the impression
      that, due to construction work, a lot of people are unsure about the
      future of green spaces in the Seestadt.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Game</h3>
    <p>
      Through a design game we wanted to find possible user patterns and
      behavior in a playful way. The game was called BusyCity and focused on the
      urban paths and stress reduction measures of people. People had to visit
      different destinations throughout the game. But with every movement they
      accumulated stress that could only be reduced by stopping at fictional
      green spaces on the map. Players had to integrate those in their game
      paths and argue what activities or things reduced their stress level.
      Various action cards were implemented to give the game a competitive
      character. The major goal was to learn how people handle stress and how
      they reduce it. The playful element of a game should help them to open up
      and reveal information through their personal playing style.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game consisted of a special map that is inspired by the Seestadt. In
      the end BusyCity included 5 different action cards and 50 destination
      cards. Each destination card featured a short story to give players a more
      realistic setting. The 3D-printed player figures held the stress rings,
      which were accumulated in the game.
    </p>

    <p> In the end, the results from a game event showed us that people choose different activities to reduce stress. Some prefer to do physical exercise while others try to relax with various entertainment measures, like listening to music. But most had a destination focused mindset and accumulated stress on their paths and reduced it when it was already apparent. Only a minor group tried to include stress reduction in their paths. </p>

    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <p> To find possible situations where our idea might be useful we created two scenarios with different contexts. As a first step, we created five personas of Seestadt citizens. The first scenario revolved around a father and his two children. They use an information panel that suggests an alternative path for them. This panel motivates them for a more physical mobility and the integration of urban green spaces in their daily paths. The second scenario was about the integration of system that helps citizens to reduce stress by visiting urban green spaces. </p>

    <h3>Narrative Poster</h3>
    <p> The last step of the "Ideation" phase included a presentation of the methods we conducted and the findings we gathered. To support this presentation, we created a narrative poster that helped us to reflect upon the collected data and show the key insights we gathered. </p>

    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
    <p> In the Prototyping phase of the project we used the gathered data from the previous semester to build a prototype of our system. The most valuable insights about mobility habits of people and the role of urban nature in their daily lives were that a lot of people like the idea of stress reduction with urban green spaces. But often they lack the motivation or do not have enough time to include nature in their daily mobility. Furthermore the Seestadt is a difficult place to conduct such a project since nature can be very sparse and is often concentrated to specific areas, like the lake. People often argued that modern urban city life can be very stressful. But activities in urban nature can improve mental health and reduce stress. In the design game we got the impression that people mostly associate entertainment and sporting activities with stress reduction. Because of this we will develop a system that shows the citizens of Seestadt probably unknown urban green spaces in combination with activites suggested by other users. </p>

    <p>After conducting several research methods during the last semester, we discovered that in our contemporary and mainly urban society, stress and mental health are increasingly relevant issues. It seems that spending more time in the nature, doing physical activities, as well as sharing experiences with other people, may help to handle those issues and to increase the quality of life. These are the reasons that lead us to develop a project aimed to reduce people’s daily stress, motivating them to spend more time outdoor and to share their favorite places and activities with other people. While doing so, people can also discover all the new places and new activities that are suggested by the others. Since this project was also aimed to be developed in Seestadt, we decided to call it ”SeeMore”.</p>

    <p>SeeMore is an interactive system that aims to introduce Seestadt citizens to unknown urban green spaces and to allow them to try out new activities they can do there. SeeMore consists of two main parts for the users to interact with. The so called SeeExplorer is a hand held device with a touchscreen that is used to find the SeeCubes inside urban green spaces. The SeeCubes are simple and little objects that the users have to find, in order to be led to new places inside of Seestadt’s urban green spaces. When users manage to find a SeeCube, through the use of the SeeExplorer, they have to activate a scanning process by placing the SeeCube close to the SeeExplorer, in order to prove they actually found it. When the users successfully scanned a SeeCube, the SeeExplorer’s screen shows an activity, which was written by one of the previous users. After completing this activity it is possible to write a new activity and change the location of the SeeCube to share them with the next users.</p>


    <p>SeeMore is made by two parts: a SeeExplorer and several SeeCubes. The first is used to find the latter, which are hidden all around Seestadt, mainly in urban or green areas. While looking for a SeeCube, the user is led to find new places in Seestadt. When the user finds a SeeCube, he or she has to scan it using the SeeExplorer. In this way, it will be possible to read what is saved on the SeeCube. Every SeeCube has a chip, on which the users can save their favourite outdoor activities, in order to share them with the users that will use SeeMore after them. The name SeeMore is a reference to the Seestadt and the activies and places that it introduces. It consists of the See-part that suggests a connection to the Seestadt. But it also shows that the user sees, in the context of perception, something new. The More indicates that new places and activities can be found with SeeMore. It suggests that there are undiscovered things in urban green spaces in the Seestadt. Accordingly the mobile device is called SeeExplorer since it helps to explore the Seestadt. The hidden objects are called SeeCubes because of their form and to give a hint what the user is looking for before he or she has seen a hidden object for the first time. The users we are referring to are all the Seestadt citizens that might feel too stressed by their daily life or that might just want to do something different in the place in which they live in. In particular, we thought mostly about young families and young adults.</p>

<h3>Sketches, Wireframes, Mockup</h3>
<p> As a first step we created sketches with pen and paper to visualize ideas and to help the other team members to understand ones ideas. </p>
<p> One of the main features of our system is the SeeCube, an object that the users hide and look for in the Seestadt. In order to motivate users to explore new areas of the city and to spend more time in nature, it is important that they hide the SeeCube in public urban green spaces. Sketches helped us to understand if and how our future users could approach this task and what possible hiding places exist in the Seestadt. </p>

<div class="image-grid">
    IMAGES HERE
</div>

<p> The SeeCube is the object that the users have to find and hide in Seestadt. This allows them to explore the area and to visit new places. We created some sketches in order to get an impression of how this object could look like and to understand what its appearance would have entailed. One idea was to enable users to store various objects in the SeeCube so they can share them with the next person. Thus we thought about possible things that can be included, like pictures, pen and paper, or natural objects. </p>

<div class="image-grid">
    IMAGES HERE
</div>

<p> The SeeExplorer is a small mobile device that is used to locate the SeeCubes and interacts with them. When a user finds a SeeCube with the help of a SeeExplorer, she or he has to use it to establish a connection with the SeeCube. The SeeExplorer then shows the activity to the user who can complete the task that the previous user left. After this, the user is able to change the position of the SeeCube and define a new task for the next person. </p>
<p> With a wireframe we represented structure, hierarchies, annotations and other general information displayed on the SeeExplorer. Since we wanted to test if the navigation through the application is understandable, we decided to implement a high-fidelity wireframe in Figma. We included detailed explanations about every page to make it as communicative as possible. We then organized all our wireframes in a storyboard, in order to better visualize the flow of the user journey. This helped us to detect problems and to address some inconsistencies. We also used the storyboard method to adjust the order of some tasks and screens in a more logical way. After we finished the wireframe we tested the flow of wireframes with some potential future users. We gathered their feedback and used it to fix possible problems before proceeding with the creation of the mockups. </p>

<div class="image-grid">
    IMAGES HERE
</div>

<p>
    After receiving the feedback from the wireframe tests, we fixed our flow and started creating the mockups of the SeeExplorer’s interface. 
</p>
<p> We decided in particular to implement a clickable high-fidelity mockup, in order to have a more realistic perspective on the final work and to have a more realistic test environment, enabling our possible future users to really sense the system while browsing it. We used Figma to complete this task as well. </p>
<div class="image-grid">IMAGES HERE</div>
<p>We tested these mockups with five potential users that did not participate in the wireframe tests, in order to prevent possible biases and to test the usability of our system. The test consisted of free exploration of the mockup while thinking out loud. Furthermore, the users answered questions about the general experience. During this phase we decided to embrace a certain look and feel in order to reflect the idea of a friendly system related to nature and relaxation. The shapes and the fonts are rounded, to suggest a relaxed and sympathetic atmosphere. The colors reflect the colors of the nature of the Seestadt, but bright at the same time, to emphasize the playful spirit of the system. The background is white, in order to increase the contrast and to optimize the legibility on the screen, which is supposed to be used in sunny environments.</p>
<h3>Technology Probe</h3>
<p> In order to gain more insights into the hardware and technology we plan to use in our project, we conducted a technology probe. This research method is used to gather information about user interaction and user feedback and also the properties of future technologies. Technology probes have three goals: understanding the needs and desires of users in a real-world setting, fieldtesting the technology, and inspiring users and researchers to think about new technologies. In our technology probe we focued on the scanning of SeeCubes with the SeeExplorer. We believed it is important to test this process, because it involves user interaction and it can be error prone in the final prototype. </p>
<p> Some of the key features of SeeMore are scanning a SeeCube after it has been found, the SeeExplorer showing an activity to do, and also giving to the users the possibility to change the activity afterwards. It is therefore important to make sure that this parts work without issues (e.g. scanning of the SeeCubes) on the hardware side, and also that everything is clearly understandable and usable for the user on the software side. The main goal of our technology probe is to test the user interface (UI) interactions and the hardware functionality needed to create a new activity in the system. This spans the scanning of a SeeCube over doing an activity to writing and saving a new activity. Our conducted technology probe aims to answer the following questions: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Can users recognize the SeeCube as part of the system?</li>
    <li>Does scanning of the SeeCube work fast and reliably?</li>
    <li>Do the users understand the system, or do they encounter any difficulties?</li>
    <li> How do users interact with the SeeExplorer and the SeeCubes (e.g. how do they hold the devices when scanning a SeeCube or when writing a new activity)? </li>
    <li>Are users comfortable while handling the SeeExplorer and while interacting with the whole system?</li>
</ul>
<div class="image-grid">IMAGES HERE</div>
<p> The results showed that there is a lack of clear instructions on what the users need to do on certain views and how to proceed to the next view. While building the technology probe we realized that we are able to reduce the technology inside the SeeCubes to a minimum. This also allows us to make them more flexible. As next a next step we improved the UI and the prototype functionality based on the insights gained from the technology probe.</p>
<h3>The Prototype</h3>
<p>Like mentioned, the look and feel of SeeMore aims to show its playful connection to urban nature. The colors, fonts, and shapes of the UI were intentionally chosen to reflect this connection. The materials, used to build the physical prototypes of the SeeExplorer and the SeeCubes, recall nature as well.</p>
<h4>SeeExplorer</h4>
<p> The SeeExplorer’s cover is made of a solid cardboard and it is covered with a wooden tape, to maintain visual and tactile consistency with the SeeCubes. </p>
<div class="image-grid">IMAGES HERE</div>
<h4>SeeCubes</h4>
<p> The SeeCubes are made of a light wood and feature rounded corners, recalling nature and maintaining consistency with the rounded shape of font and buttons of the SeeExplorer's UI. This allows them to fit into the natural environment of the Seestadt. But it also enabling them to be seen by the users without getting noticed too much by people that are not looking for them. </p>
<div class="image-grid">IMAGES HERE</div>
<h3>Additional Material</h3>
<p>At the end of the course we presented the prototype to citizens of the Seestadt, the lecturer, and to the students from the other groups. Initially it was planned that the presentation would be held in the aspern.mobil LAB in the Seestadt but due to the COVID-19 situation it was held online. We therefore made a presentation (German) and a short video to show the prototype in a real world setting. </p>
