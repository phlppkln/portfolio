                During my study I first got in touch with mobile development during a project where I had to design and develop an Android game. There my group partner and I created a Jump-And-Run game, called The Apple. I enjoyed the design and development process a lot and wanted to do something similar in my bachelorâ€™s thesis. So I created an Android smartphone app where people had to enter words in a mobile gaming environment. Since writing is a fundamental skill on smartphones, this should help them improve their writings skills. 
                </p>
        <p>Afterwards a user study was conducted. It used the game to observe potential changes in typing behavior when an error tolerance is introduced in such games. Therefore various measurements were tracked during gaming. </p>
        <h2>Used Tools and Software</h2>
        <p> Android Studio, Google Play Services, Java, REST+JSON, Pen+Paper, JASP (User Tests Analysis)</p>
