    Hi, I am Philipp.
</h1>   
<p>
    I am a graduate from TU Wien with a Master's degree in "Media and Human-Centered Computing". My educational journey has revolved around the realm of Human-Computer
    Interaction (HCI) and the art of integrating digital
    technology into our lives, always with a human-centered approach at
    its core.
</p>

<p>
    I am passionate about about the interplay between design and human
    perception through technology, particularly by
    exploring novel ways to harness interactivity and collaboration to
    enhance our understanding of information and ignite our creativity.
