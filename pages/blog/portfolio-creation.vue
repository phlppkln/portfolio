            <p>Never use individual and selected colors in your design. Best is to design only with a wireframe of your page. This allows you to resist the temptation to add colors to your design.
                You always need to rely on the colors defined in the theme,</p>
                <p>New tools like uizard enable designers to create a vast amount of content easily. If a single prompt can generate an idea for the design of a project, we are tempted to do exactly that. 

                    I feel like, with all the possibilities and opportunities of AI in the design process, to truly generate innovate ideas and concepts we still need designers and developers that are willing to put in 
                    an effort create something new. AI only allows us to create something that has already been there and proved to be useful for humans. However, we can never know what new and exciting things might work as well
                    if we never create them. That's where we, as humans, can leverage the abilities of AI to get a wide range of ideas quick and easy. The challenging thing is to get the inspiration you need for the project you have in your mind.
                    Because if you have an idea, an design you want to follow or an experiment that you want to implement, you still need to create it yourself. AI is only a tool that helps us in the learning process, find mistakes, 
                    explore unthought-of ideas and make the overall process faster.
