    <h1>Information Overload: Causes and Countermeasure Approaches</h1>

    <div class="text row">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Every interaction with a digital device produces data, which in turn is 
        then used in many modern user interfaces to show information in a certain way. 
        This makes it possible to also show a myriad of content to users. To select 
        the best and desired information can the user get the relevant and right
        amount of information to the user. This can be a challenging task since
        too much information can be overwhelming for people which leads to the
        Information Overload (IO) problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Section 2 this report gives an introduction to the term ”information
        overload”. It describes and discusses different definition based on
        literature and gives examples on some of its main causes. IO is a major
        challenge in Human-ComputerInteraction (HCI) therefore Section 3 shows
        the importance of IO in HCI and gives examples of countermeasure
        approaches for today's and future applications.
      </p>
      <h2>2 Information Overload</h2>
      <p>
        Today, especially interactions with devices that are connected to an
        online service, create a vast amount of information. This so called
        digital footprint is a increasingly popular term to address the
        information people generate with every digital interaction. Blue et al.
        argue that these dig ital footprints log the habits, interests,
        relationships, and communications of peoples physical lives [1]. These
        enormous amounts of data make it difficult for designers and developers
        to distinguish between valuable and unnecessary information. New
        information and communications technology allow to display data in many
        different forms. But one of the problems that occur from the
        interconnection of the digital and physical world is the amount of
        information that people are confronted with. Humans often cannot process
        everything they perceive and some valuable information might be lost.
        This problem is frequently called information or data overload. Although
        this issue has become more significant in recent years, scientists
        already addressed this topic before computers were such an important
        part of society. Milord and Perry, for example, mention the issue of
        information overload in 1977. They argue that information overload is
        caused by an individual's perception not by the input-output capacity of
        a system [8]. For them it is a psychological phenomenon because the type
        and density of data should not be determined by the used technology. It
        should consider the human as the most important part of an information
        visualization. Since then further research has been conducted that
        examined the information and data overload problem in our current
        society [12][4][6][9]. All of them argue that IO is a major challenge of
        our digitized and globalized world.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Rachfall et al. it is hard to filter the important
        information if people are con fronted with a flood of data [9]. They
        argue that, when people talk about IO, they usually mean that they get
        too much information they cannot process. But Rachfall et al. describe
        that information overload is tightly connected to the scientific
        discipline. This makes it difficult to come up with an universal
        definition for the term ”information overload”. Rachfall et al. argue
        that different situations require different descriptions for IO.
        Sometimes it is ”an accumulation of information which can’t be processed
        because of the limited possibilities of the human brain” [9, p. 28]. In
        other situations IO is defined as ”an excessive amount of information of
        which just small amounts are relevant” [9, p. 28]. Based on a work by
        Tushman and Nadler ([11]) they came up with the formula: information
        processing requirements (IPR) > information processing capacities (IPC)
        to define IO [9]. According to Rachfall et al. IPC is based on the
        individual's cognitive capacity which is influenced by aspects like
        willingness, motivation, knowledge, etc. IPR on the other hand is
        characterized by non-individual aspects like presentation format, time
        pressure, etc. It describes the capacity that is needed to solve the
        problem or make a decision. Based on this assumptions Rachfall et al.
        came up with a framework to define the term "Information Overload".
        Figure 1 illustrates the framework. It suggests that IO occurs if the
        IPR is bigger than the IPC. Rachfall et al. argue that their framework
        captures definitions of various research on information overload.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Causes of Information Overload</h3>
      <p>
        According to Rachfall et al. different types of information have
        different effects on IO. Their developed framework (see Figure 1) was
        used in a case study to distinguish between bad-, irrelevant-, or
        relevant information. Its goal was to find a possible relationship
        between the types of information and IO. They conducted their study in
        four companies with management accountants. Rachfall et al. discovered
        that too much bad information leads to the information overload
        phenomenon. But too much relevant information has a positive effect on
        IO as well. On the other hand they found no correlation between the
        amount of irrelevant information and IO. Overall Rachfall et al. argue
        that there is a connection between information type and information
        overload.
      </p>
      <p>
        A related concept to information overload is Data Overload (DO). Both
        terms are often used interchangeably although they are different. Like
        already mentioned, Rachfall et al. ([9]) define the term information
        overload as an individuals capability to process information in relation
        to the displayed information. They think that IO is heavily influenced
        by the user and peoples ability to process information. Data overload on
        the other hand is more focused on the data that needs to be handled.
        Woods et al. think that DO is one of the major problems in our current
        world [12]. Especially in our digital world everybody creates a lot of
        data that needs to be processed. They argue that it is crucial to find
        the root causes of data overload first. Otherwise it is not possible to
        suggest appropriate solutions. In their work Woods et al. describe three
        basic characteristics of DO. They argue that DO is a difficult problem
        and the characteristics allow to better understand its causes. The first
        characterization is that often too much data is present. They describe
        it as a clutter problem because too much stuff is displayed. Although a
        reduction of the number of displayed data bits is a possible solution,
        Woods et al. think that this misinterprets the problem. They argue that
        this approach is often not fruitful because in many contexts, some of
        what is removed is valuable information. Woods et al. call the second
        characterization workload as bottleneck. They describe it as a time
        related problem because too much data needs to be analyzed in too few
        time. They argue that this problem can be partly solved by automation
        technologies. Such technologies should support the user during their
        activities. Although this is a potentially useful approach, they also
        argue that it is not sufficient all the time. The last characterization
        is the finding of significance in data. Woods et al. argue that the last
        characterization is the most important one, because it allows to create
        truly useful solutions. They think that machine learning allows to
        better organize data. The biggest problem is that the significance of
        data depends on the context. [12] argue that the value of the
        information in the data is not absolute and therefore the finding of
        significance is a challenging task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until now this report focused on the ”unintentional” causes of IO like
        browsing the web or using all kinds of digital services. Normally those
        can only be avoided by not using those products but not all data
        generation fall in that category. Gamzu et al. argue that some of the
        data overload people are confronted with, is self inflicted [4]. They
        examined the information overload created by emails, especially from
        junk mails. According to them machine-generated mail make up more than
        90% of non-spam mail traffic, which means that users demanded those
        mails in the form of subscriptions. They argue that this is major
        contributor to information overload in email. But Gamzu et al. also
        found that there is a significant gap between users wish to reduce the
        number of those mails and their active behavior to do so. They think
        that this lack of willingness to reduce the IO in their mail traffic is
        due to inaccessible and complex mechanisms to unsubscribe. Although
        Gamzu et al. conducted their study in the context of subscriptions to
        email services, the overall message can be derived to IO in general.
        Gamzu et al. suggest that users need a simple and accessible way to
        decrease the IO in digital products, otherwise the complexity and effort
        to reduce IO exceeds the perceived benefits.
      </p>

      <h2>3 Information Overload and Human-Computer-Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        The low cost of data collection and storage led to a vast number of
        possible information to dis play. Designers often need to confront users
        with information that is considered crucial to the product but the
        problem of information overload can occur if too much information is
        shown to users. Thus IO is a very important topic in HCI nowadays and
        designers have to consider it in their products. To give the best user
        experience it is necessary to show the right amount of information in
        the most efficient way possible. Like mentioned IO is dependent on the
        individuals perceptions and processing abilities. Therefore every person
        has a different IO threshold. This is a major problem when defining the
        right amount of information that can be included in a product without
        overwhelming the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        One approach to find appropriate measures to detect individuals
        threshold of workload was done by Gevins and Smith. They argue that one
        of the key challenges regarding cognitive work load is the problem of
        how to accurately measure it [5]. An electroencephalogram (EEG) allows
        to monitor brain function, thus it is very sensitive to alertness and
        attention. Gevins and Smith argue that an EEG can measure cognitive
        workload because tasks that require different mental effort cause
        changes in brain activity. They reviewed a long-term study that aimed to
        monitor cognitive workload methods based on EEG measures. They evaluated
        different tasks in various computer based contexts to achieve more
        natural results. Gevins and Smith think that EEG measures can be
        effective to detect variations in cognitive workload in laboratory
        settings. But they also suggests that a real-world environment study
        would be beneficial for further applications. Overall Gevins and Smith
        argue that their work has shown "initial evidence for the feasibility of
        creating EEG-based technologies for monitoring cognitive workload during
        human-computer-interaction" [5, p. 125].
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many problematic fields of application where IO can cause
        security issues or might be harmful, for example new technologies, like
        smart cars. Hwangbo et al. evaluated the complexity of in-vehicle
        interface system [6]. They argue that drives have to process visual
        information in split seconds within a minimal field of view area.
        Hwangbo et al. conclude that the ”development of in-vehicle technology
        has brought about several critical issues such as driver distraction”
        [6, p. 82]. Therefore their research shows the necessity for research on
        IO and display complexity in critical systems like smart cars.
      </p>
      <h3>3.1 Countermeasure Approaches</h3>
      <p>
        Information overload is a complex topic in HCI that needs to be
        considered carefully. The information handling capabilities of everyone
        is different and the amount of information that a person can process
        without being overwhelmed by the complexity or amount of information
        depends on various aspects. But the problem of IO has already been
        addressed by researchers and designers that came up with different
        countermeasure approaches. This section gives three possible techniques
        how current or future products can reduce IO.
      </p>
      <h4>3.1.1 Data visualization</h4>
      <p>
        Big data is a major topic in computer science nowadays. Like already
        mentioned, everybody creates a lot of data constantly. Cota et al. argue
        that big data is used to generate knowledge and facilitate decision
        making [3]. But the major challenge is, how to visualize all the data
        without losing crucial information. Currently a lot of techniques exist
        to represent data, like tables, histograms, charts, treemaps, etc. Cota
        et al. think that today the main challenge for various forms of data
        representation are the scalability and dynamism of data. Current
        technologies represent data in 2D but Cota et al. argue that future
        visualizations will move towards three-dimensional graphs since it
        allows to display more information in an efficient way
      </p>

      <h4>3.1.2 Simplicity</h4>
      <p>
        A widespread countermeasure is to display only the necessary and useful
        information. So called, minimalism or simplicity is a very popular term
        when designing user interfaces. Although Chang et al. focused on
        interaction design in general, their research can be applied to the
        representation of information as well [2]. They argue that attaining
        simplicity is a key challenge in interaction design because designers
        tend to have featuritis which they define as "the tendency for designers
        to emphasize the number or novelty of features over core usability"
        Chang et al.. According to Chang et al. the mental and physical clutter
        in user interfaces increases with device functionality. This leads to
        the assumptions that current and future applications tend to include
        more features that increase the IO of products. Other researchers and
        design best practices argue that simplicity is crucial to increase user
        experience and build better user interfaces, but it needs to be
        carefully implemented [10]. Otherwise too much information gets lost and
        users might get frustrated when using a product.
      </p>

      <h4>3.1.3 Recommendation Systems</h4>
      <p>
        Khusro et al. highlight the importance of recommendation systems to
        handle IO [7]. They define a recommender system as an ”Information
        Retrieval technology that improves access and proactively recommends
        relevant items to users by considering the users' explicitly mentioned
        preferences and objective behaviors” [7, p. 1179]. Such preferences are
        based on a users profile which consists of personal information, items
        visited, rated, purchased, etc. Khusro et al. argue that today's
        recommender systems are not precise enough to fulfill all users' needs.
        Thus the major challenge for future applications are to create
        fine-tuned and high-quality recommender systems. According to them,
        future recommender systems should 1) use demographic filtering and
        clustering, 2) obtain personal information of newly registered users, 3)
        maintain two recommendation lists for users who frequently change their
        preferences, and 4) filter out obsolete and old items.
      </p>
      <h2>4 Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This report gave a brief introduction to information overload. Although
        information overload is a very complex topic and a definition depends on
        the context, the user is a key factor when determining the right amount
        of information integrated into a system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general definition is that information overload happens when the
        information processing requirements exceed the information processing
        capabilities of a user. Thus it is a important topic for HCI because IO
        cannot be separated from the user. The causes of IO are rather complex
        but in general they can be unintentional or self inflicted. But the
        information processing abilities is different for every person. To
        determine the right amount of information various factors need to be
        considered. This report gave the example of an EEG to monitor the
        information workload threshold of people in a laboratory setting.
        Although this approach is not applicable to real-world applications it
        gives an example how to determine of the right amount of information in
        user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today many different countermeasure approaches exist and this report
        gave three examples. First it is possible to carefully think about the
        visualization technique that is used in today's interfaces. Cota et al.
        argue that big data led to a vast amount of information that can be
        displayed [3]. Future application will need to consider new techniques
        like 3D representations to handle all this information. Another very
        popular technique is to implement simplicity or minimalism in user
        interfaces although it can be challenging to display only the most
        important data. The last suggestions this report includes are
        recommender systems. These consider a users previous behavior to find
        the most relevant information for them. Overall this report showed that
        information overload is a very challenging topic in HCI nowadays and
        trends like big data show that it will be important in future
        applications as well. Although various countermeasure approaches exits a
        combination of AI and human interaction techniques will be crucial to
        combat the issue of IO in the future.
